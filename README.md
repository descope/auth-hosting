# Descope Authentication Hosting App

This is a React web application that runs Descope's login flows according to the project created in your [Descope](https://app.descope.com) account.

### Deployment

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdescope%2Fauth-hosting&env=DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID&demo-title=Descope%20Hosted%20Auth%20Page&demo-description=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdescope%2Fauth-hosting%2F%23readme&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fauth.descope.io%2F)

By default, the app is deployed to the Descope hosting page in [https://auth.descope.io](https://auth.descope.io).  
The main purpose is to allow easy integration for descopers implementing authentication with Descope (such as OIDC [use case](#open-id-connect-oidc-use-cases-in-descope)).

In case you want to have your own hosted page (customize styling, your own domain, etc.), you can use this repository as a template, do the relevant modification and host it (using Vercel, etc.)

#### Open ID Connect (OIDC) use cases in Descope

Descope allows you to integrate with your existing Identity Provider (IdP) via OpenID Connect (OIDC) or with any deployed OIDC client.  
With this implementation, you can seamlessly add Descope authentication to your application utilizing any OIDC provider.

You can refer to either the [main documentation](https://docs.descope.com/customize/auth/oidc) on how to set it up, or you can review a few of the tutorials published that showcase how to use Descope with many major existing identity providers:

- [Auth0](https://docs.descope.com/knowledgebase/sso/auth0oidc)
- [Cognito](https://docs.descope.com/knowledgebase/sso/cognitooidc)
- [Firebase](https://www.descope.com/blog/post/passkeys-firebase-oidc)

### Running locally

- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`
- Go to `http://localhost:3000/<PROJECT_ID>`

**Using URL params**

- Descope's deployment: `https://auth.descope.io/<PROJECT_ID>`
- Locally: `http://localhost:3000/<PROJECT_ID>?flow=sign-in&debug=true`

`<PROJECT_ID>` as part of the URL path is required to use the desired Descope's `PROJECT_ID`  
`flow` query parameter is optional. If none provided the default flow is `sign-up-or-in`  
`debug` query parameter is optional. If debug mode is needed use `debug=true`

**Using .env**

In case you don't want to provide the project ID as part of the URL, you can specify it as an environment variable `DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID`.  
You can use `.env` file for that.  
From the project root directory run: `cp .env.example .env`, and set your Descope Project and flow IDs.
